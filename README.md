# Foram_Detection

Note: This repository is not yet complete.  main.py and functions.py will be added in coming days.

Detect and save photos of foraminifers as well as the parameters used during detection 

main.py should be the only file the user needs to run.  All other files must be downloaded and stored in the same folder as main.py so that they can be called by main.py as needed.

Amscope folder contains the necessary code to open and communicate with the Amscope Camera.  This folder will need to be downloaded for the system to work, but it should not necessarily need to be opened or ran by the user.
